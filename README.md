e-plantShopping
 The front end of a "Paradise Nursery" shopping application.
 The application interface will allow you to browse a variety of houseplants and add them to a shopping cart.
 The shopping cart feature lets you see all your items and their total cost.
 Your shopping cart should also allow you to adjust the number of items in the cart before checkout.

 The application has three pages: a landing page, a product listing page, and a shopping cart page.

 Landing Page
 This page has the following elements:
    A background image
    A paragraph about the company
    The company name
    A "Get Started" button linking to the product page

 Product Listing Page
 This page has sections for plants in individual cards each with:
    A thumbnail image
    Plant name
    Description
    Price
    An Add to Cart button

 Shopping Cart Page
 The shopping cart page displays all the details about the items in it.
 It prominently displays the total number of plants in the cart,
 the total cost of all items in the cart, a continue shopping button, and a checkout button.
 On this page, you should be able to see:
    Each type of plant in the shopping cart
    Its thumbnail
    Its name
 It also displays its unit price and the total of all the items in the cart.
 An increase or decrease button to change the number of that plant type in the cart is provided.
 That also updates the shopping cart icon in the header and the total number of items in the cart.
 Finally, a delete button for each type of plant in the cart is also included.
